# Dundie Rewards Project

[![CI](https://github.com/VictorMirandaEE/dundie-rewards/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/VictorMirandaEE/dundie-rewards/actions/workflows/main.yml)

We were hired by Dunder Mifflin, a large paper manufacturer, to develop a rewards system for their employees.

Michael, the company manager, wants to increase employee motivation by offering a system of points that employees can accumulate according to their goals achieved, bonuses offered by the manager, and employees can also exchange points among themselves.

Employees can redeem their points on a credit card once a year to spend wherever they want.

We agreed in the contract that the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) would be a version to be run on the terminal and, in the future, it will also have UI, web, and API interfaces.

Current employee data will be provided in a file in .csv or .json formats, which can be used for future versions. `Name, Department, Position, Email`
